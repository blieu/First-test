(21) As a game designer, I want a parser so that I can load and test different maps.
   -Parser.cc/.h class files (5hr)
   -parse() function(2hr)

(8) As a developer, a game class allows us to do basic game logic and connect the other components.
    -Combine other classes together in a coherent way (time unsure)

    -implement SFML GUI elements (10hr)
    -functions for button clicks (5hr)
    -taking output from parser and creating buttons (10hr)

(1) As a game player, I want a title and logo so that I can easily recognize the game, have brand loyalty, and have a name I can use to recommend it to everyone I know.

(5) As a game developer, I want to be able to define my own variables in order to customize how the user interacts with my game.
